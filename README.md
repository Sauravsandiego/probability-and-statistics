## Project Description

This project focuses on predicting the quality of red wine based on various physicochemical properties. The dataset used comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, consisting of **1599** red wine samples, each described by **12** features including acidity, alcohol content, pH, and sugar concentration.

### Dataset Overview:
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Variables**: 12 physicochemical attributes (e.g., fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, pH, alcohol content, etc.)
- **Target**: Quality score on a scale of 0â€“10
- **Classes**: The quality score is categorized into three labels: Low (0-4), Medium (5-6), and High (7-10).

### Key Steps:
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, scaled features using RobustScaler, and categorized quality ratings into three classes.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features.
- **Modeling**: Applied various machine learning models including XGBoost and CatBoost. XGBoost was selected as the final model after hyperparameter tuning, providing the best balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.
- **Handling Class Imbalance**: SMOTE was used to generate synthetic samples for underrepresented classes, ensuring fair model performance across all wine quality levels.

### Key Challenges:
- Class imbalance, where the "Medium" quality class was overrepresented compared to "Low" and "High" quality classes, which was addressed through SMOTE.
- Fine-tuning XGBoost for optimal performance took significant experimentation with hyperparameters.
